# Ramp and Projectile Lab Simulation

This is an interactive HTML5/JavaScript simulation for a ramp and projectile lab experiment.  
It visually models the motion of a ball rolling down a ramp, crossing a table (with adjustable friction), and launching as a projectile.  
The simulation can be used for physics labs to explore concepts such as kinematics, dynamics, and projectile motion.

## Features

- **Adjustable Parameters**:
  - Table height
  - Ramp angle and start height
  - Table surface friction coefficient (Î¼)
  - Launch ramp angle
- **Simulation Modes**:
  - Realistic mode (with random measurement error)
  - Math mode (idealized, no error)
- **Visual Features**:
  - Live trajectory and range display
  - Camera panning to follow the projectile
  - Shadow rendering for depth perception
  - Trail effect to highlight the projectileâ€™s path
- **Responsive Controls**:
  - Range sliders and numeric input for precision
  - Reset and start buttons
  - Optional error simulation toggle

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `table_ramp.html` file in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).
3. Adjust simulation parameters using the sliders or input fields.
4. Click **Start Simulation** to run the model.
5. Click **Reset** to reset the simulation to initial values.

No installation or additional libraries are required since the simulation runs entirely in the browser.
